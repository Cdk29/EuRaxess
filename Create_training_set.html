Applications are invited for a PhD studentship funded by the Faculty of Medicine and Health working under the supervision of Dr David Vauzour and Pr Michael Müller.   Although there is a vast body of research on age-related neurodegeneration associated with cognitive decline, there has been little focus on the impact of the host-microbial derived products on brain physiology and impact on neurodegenerative disorders. This project will extend our ongoing programme of work in the gut-brain axis by measuring microbiota derived biomarkers which have potential for use in earlier diagnosis and monitoring the trajectory of dementia. In particular, this project will explore new fluid biomarkers using cutting-edge methods including shotgun metagenomics and targeted metabolomics utilising bio-archived and newly collected bio-fluids (faeces, blood, urine) from highly characterised longitudinal and clinical cohorts. The project should appeal to candidates interested in gut physiology, metabolism and neuroscience in preventing age-related cognitive decline and dementia. The student will join the Norwich Medical School which provides a supportive research environment and access to experienced researchers. The student will receive training in targeted metabolomics, metagenomics, and computational modelling (machine learning). In addition to their research the student will be provided with training in scientific writing, presentation, data management, statistical analysis and will be encouraged to attend and present at national and international conferences.

Human cryptosporidiosis is the leading protozoan cause of diarrhoeal mortality worldwide, and most infection is caused by either person to person transmitted Cryptosporidium hominis or the presumptively zoonotic C. parvum. However, C. parvum actually splits into two subclades. One, which we have newly identified as C. parvum anthroponosum is also predominantly spread person to person and shares a subset of loci with C. hominis that are undergoing rapid convergent evolution driven by positive selection. This subspecies predominates in lower-income countries with poor sanitation and in HIV positive individuals, in contrast to higher-income countries where it is rarely evident. In the course of their studies the student will characterize this new subspecies of parasite providing an annotated reference genome, will evaluate whether its virulence is greater than the zoonotic form, propagating the parasite and genetically transforming it to evaluate the role of the shared loci in adaptation to the human digestive tract. The student will further develop diagnostic tools to discriminate this group of parasites. The student will be supported by Earlham institute for the genomic aspects of the project and will be affiliated with the EU interreg program H4DC on cryptosporidium which is concerned with production of new drugs and diagnostics for cryptosporidium.

Please login to use this functionality.  The position is in the team “Cellular and Molecular Pathophysiology of Obesity and Diabetes (http://www.unice.fr/c3m/index.php/research-teams/jean-francois-tanti-mireille-cormont/) which is part of the Inserm Center “Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Medicine (C3M) at the University Côte d’Azur (Nice, France). The position is funded by the Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale. The team investigates the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of the insulin resistance associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with a special focus on the molecular and cellular mechanisms connecting the pathological expansion and dysfunction of adipose tissue to the development of insulin resistance in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. The team within the C3M Center constitutes a strong and creative research environment with strong national and international collaborations. The focus of the project is to study the role of a regulator of the transcription factor p53 in the function of the brown adipose tissue and the beige adipocytes and its implication in the development of obesity and insulin resistance. This will be done by studying the metabolic phenotype of mice with a specific invalidation of this protein in thermogenic adipocytes.  The salary depends on the successful candidate’s qualifications and experience with a minimum of 56,200 euros per year taxes included.  Eligible for the appointment as postdoctoral researcher are applicants holding a doctoral degree in biology (PhD) The doctoral degree should have been awarded no more than five years prior to the application deadline.

## 6: Where to send your application. Please login to use this functionality.  The Ahringer laboratory at the Wellcome/CRUK Gurdon Institute is seeking a talented and motivated Senior Bioinformatician to join their research laboratory. Our research programmes aim to decipher how eukaryotic gene expression and genome architecture are regulated in development, using the powerful and tractable model organism C. elegans (http://www.ahringer.group.gurdon.cam.ac.uk/). Our research investigates regulatory elements, chromatin domains, and 3D genome organization establish gene expression programmes that drive cellular identity. The successful candidate will actively and collaboratively lead and contribute to different projects, using existing cutting-edge software or devising new methods to analyse genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data (e.g, ChIP-seq, Hi-C, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, single-cell analyses). They will play a fundamental role in analysing data produced by wet-lab scientists, generating hypotheses, and contributing their own innovative ideas. Working in close contact with experimental scientists, they will participate in research activities of the laboratory as a whole. They will also be responsible for developing and running analysis pipelines and maintaining our large database of sequencing datasets. Candidates should have a strong background in bioinformatics and statistics, prior experience in the analysis of high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic data, and excellent computer skills (programming including an advanced knowledge of R and sequence analysis software). Prior experience with single-cell data analyses would be an advantage. Candidates should also have a PhD in a relevant subject, a sound understanding of molecular biology, and a strong publication track record in bioinformatics. Candidates are expected to work independently and interact well in a dynamic multidisciplinary team environment. They will have abilities in methods development and project management, and be able to communicate ideas and results clearly.
