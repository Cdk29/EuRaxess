Title: Functions to scrappe and summarize job offers from Euraxess
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Functions to scrappe and summarize job offers from EuRaxess. Why ? Job offers are often poorly filled
  on EuRaxess, title descriptions are even worse, and jobs are the interface of biology/medicine and computer science
  like bioinformatics cannot be search directly (it is required to look inside biology, computer science, etc). Some
  jobs at such interface can be inside differents ITN. For such reason and because there is a lot of offers on this
  website (at least 400 pages will be scrapped on the first iteration), a best approach is to use text mining to ease
  the process.
